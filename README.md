Are you looking for a Medicine inventory management system project? We are here to help you. Everybody in this world, some place 
on the World, and in time one needs to confront some sort of infection or wounds. The infection to fix we really want a 
Doctor to concern.

As we go to the Doctor or specialist, he analyzes the problem with us and lets us know the justification behind the 
issue, and endorses us some kind of medication. These medicines are available in medical stores. 
One needs a prescription to the store which the staff takes care of and uses that to see which medicines they need according 
to the name given to the medicine. Our system monitors complete supply of medication accessible.It robotizes the work of record  
support in a Pharmacy store shop as well it also shows the medicines which are expiring today.Also the Dashboard is interactive and  
user-freindly for the staff of the medical store. By Our  inventory i.e MEDIHEAL the workload will get less and if any bussiness needs 
extension then it can be done easily.

is classified as a multimodel database. In multimodel databases,
various database engines are natively supported and accessible
 via common APIs.
